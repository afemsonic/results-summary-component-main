### What I learned

I learnt the application of gradients.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I'll like to learn more about how to handle data.json file and how to integrate it into html. 


### Useful resources
