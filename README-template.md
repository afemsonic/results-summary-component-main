### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


### Continued development

I'll like to learn more about how to handle data.json file and how to integrate it into html. 


### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the right way to apply gradients in css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
